<h2>Why are we here?</h2>

<p>I'ts not just about the end-user!</p>
<p>
As implementers of content management systems, we're actually developing for two audiences
Our job is to strike a balance between each audience. And it's a difficult job
I'm here because, as a front-end developer who works with CMS developers, I work hard to write code that performs on the website, without making the content author learn a lot of crazy dance moves.
