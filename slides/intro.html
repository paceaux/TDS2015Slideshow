<h2>Why are we here?</h2>
<h3>It's all about the users!</h3>

<p>We have two types of users that we need to account for when we implement websites:</p>

<ul>
    <li>End-users</li>
    <li>CMS-users (content authors/editors)</li>
</ul>

<p>When we build websites, we account for both kinds of user &mdash; but usually the back-end (Tridion) developers focus on the CMS user, while the front-end developers focus primarily on the end-user. </p>

</div>
<div class="slide__content">
<h3>The Problem is the Balance</h3>
<p>If front-end developers focus exclusively on the end-user experience, without considering the content-author experience, this can create a lot of strain on the Tridion developer and the Tridion user. </p>

<p>If a Front-end developer codes, without thinking about thinking about how content will be managed, this leads to problems:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Inconsistent markup for the same content -> too many Component Templates</li>
    <li>Not enough wrappers -> Site edit becomes a pain</li>
    <li>Too many divs -> developer gets lost in code, contracts '<code>div</code>itis', perpetuates drinking problem</li>
    <li>Too many divs -> site isn't SEO friendly or accessible</li>
    <li>Classes for background images -> too many CTs, or adding lists to components for classes, thus preventing them from being used elsewhere</li>
    <li>Assuming a container always has content -> blank spaces and weird gaps</li>
    <li>Hard-coded classes for layout -> no flexibility in adding removing items</li>
    <li>Hard-coded background images and colors -> no flexibility in changing content areas</li>
    <li>Every jQuery plugin ever -> content author can't change features in a plugin</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="slide__content">
<h3>The solution is in the <del>code</del> content</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Tell the FE dev about the content models (schemas)</li>
    <li>Collect authoring rules before writing code</li>
    <li>Accept FE code that's flexible, not fixed</li>
</ol>
